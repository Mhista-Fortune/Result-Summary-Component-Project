- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I Learned

**Dynamic Data Rendering:**  
I learned how to fetch data from a local JSON file and dynamically render UI components using JavaScript, making the summary section flexible and easy to update.

**CSS Grid & Flexbox:**  
This project helped me practice positioning elements using both CSS Grid and Flexbox, and reinforced the benefits of a mobile-first workflow.

**Accessibility:**  
I improved my understanding of semantic HTML and accessibility best practices, such as using appropriate tags and alt attributes.
